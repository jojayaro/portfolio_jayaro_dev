                    Foundations: Engineering Precision and Real-Time Data
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Born in San Cristobal, Venezuela, my path into technology began with a Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Florida, specializing in Instrumentation and Measurements. This early focus on precision and data was immediately applied at the University's Hurricane Research center. Chasing storms like Dennis, Katrina, and Wilma, I gained hands-on experience in real-time data acquisition and instrumentation—foundational skills for understanding data's power in critical situations.

                    Global Operations and the Pursuit of Quality
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    As a Field Engineer with Schlumberger in Oman and Venezuela, I managed Integrated Projects and Rigs, learning adaptability and leadership in high-stakes oil and gas operations. This global experience shaped my understanding of complex systems.

                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    A move to Canada marked a pivotal shift towards Quality Control and Assurance. For six years, as a Quality Specialist for Oil and Gas equipment manufacturers, I honed my expertise in root cause analysis, incident management, and continuous improvement. This period was crucial in developing a mindset focused on designing for reliability and proactively addressing potential system failures—a core tenet of robust data architecture.
